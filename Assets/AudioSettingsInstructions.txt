AUDIO SETTINGS IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
=====================================

This document explains how to add audio volume controls to your game's settings panel.

OVERVIEW:
---------
Two scripts have been added to implement audio volume controls:
1. AudioSettingsPanel.cs - Creates and manages the sliders and labels
2. AudioSettingsUI.cs - Handles the slider logic and connects to AudioManager

The AudioManager has been updated to support separate volume controls for SFX and music categories.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------

OPTION 1: AUTOMATIC SETUP (RECOMMENDED)
---------------------------------------
1. Open your scene in the Unity Editor
2. Select your "SettingsPanel" GameObject in the Hierarchy
3. Add the "AudioSettingsPanel" component to it
4. Configure the settings in the Inspector (optional):
   - You can adjust spacing, font settings, and other visual properties 
   - You can leave contentParent empty to use the panel itself as the parent

The AudioSettingsPanel will automatically create all necessary UI elements at runtime.

OPTION 2: MANUAL SETUP
----------------------
If you prefer to set up the UI elements manually:

1. Create two sliders in your settings panel
2. Add the "AudioSettingsUI" component to your settings panel
3. Assign the sliders to the appropriate fields in the Inspector
4. Optionally create and assign TextMeshProUGUI components for displaying the volume percentages

USAGE:
------
- The music and SFX volume settings will be saved using PlayerPrefs
- Volume settings are automatically loaded when the game starts
- You can add new audio sources to the respective categories using:
  AudioManager.Instance.RegisterAudioSource(myAudioSource, isMusic);

SCALABILITY:
-----------
- The AudioManager maintains separate lists for SFX and music sources
- When new audio sources are added, they automatically use the right volume setting
- To add a new audio source at runtime, use the RegisterAudioSource method

If you need additional audio categories beyond SFX and music, you can extend the AudioManager class.

====================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
====================

1. "AudioManager instance not found"
   - Make sure the AudioManager exists in your scene
   - Check that it's properly set up as a singleton

2. Sliders not affecting volume
   - Check the Console for any errors
   - Verify that the AudioManager is correctly categorizing your audio sources

3. UI elements not appearing
   - If using automatic setup, check that the AudioSettingsPanel component is attached
   - If using manual setup, verify that all references are properly assigned
